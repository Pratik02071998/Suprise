                        <strong>Dear Anna Leah Turin Lumanas</strong>
                        <p>
                            I hope you are having a good day. Something stuck in my head and I want to convey it to you. Haven't told you anytime that I want to court you. 
                            So I am taking this opportunity today and want to say to you that Pwede bang umakyat ng ligaw?
                            If you are gonna allow me to court you. There are a couple of things you should make a note of 
                            I'm never gonna love you perfectly but I am gonna love you intentionally. I'm gonna frustrate you and irritate you by being me 
                            But I'm gonna consistently love you.
                            Some days when things mature and reach a stagnant point, where you want to run away and give up 
                            On these days I'm gonna do my best to give you a million reasons to stay.
                            I want you thick and thin by my side and there will be no place to hide 
                            I will always be me and the whole universe won't be able to change me. 
                            Hindi kita mabura sa isipan ko, Sabik na sabik na ako sa iyo and Sobrang in lab ako sa iyo.
                        <strong>your manliligaw Pratik Mehta</strong>
